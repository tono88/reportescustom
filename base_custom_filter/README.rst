Configuration
=============

1. Go to *Settings > Custom Filters*.

2. Create a record assigning model, type (search/filter/groupby) and
   necessary attributes. Available fields and corresponding attributes
   (in brackets) for each type are as follows:

   Search:

      - Search Field (``name``)
      - Filter Domain (``filter_domain``)
      - User Groups (``groups``)

   Filter:

      - Domain (``domain``)
      - User Groups (``groups``)

   Group By:

      - Group By Field (field to be assigned to ``group_by`` context)
      - User Groups (``groups``)

   See `the official
   documentation <https://www.odoo.com/documentation/16.0/developer/reference/backend/views.html#search>`__
   for the definition of each attribute. Additionally, filter and
   group-by records can be respectively grouped together with "Group"
   assignment (there will be a separator in between groups).

Usage
=====

1. Go to the model's menu entry for which you have defined the filter.
2. On the filters and group by dropdowns, you will see the configured
   filters.
