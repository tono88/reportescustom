This module allows for front and back covers to be added to the
generated PDF reports. They can be added as a separate page, at the
beginning or the end of the report, but they can also overlap the first
and last page of the actual report, respectively.

Usage
=====

To add a cover to a report, you need to access to the report's
configuration, more specifically to the Advanced Properties tab. There,
you will find two checkboxes, one for the front cover and another for
the back cover. They both work the same, so let's focus on the front
cover with an example.

- You must check the Use Front Cover checkbox to enable the front cover.
  You will see that a new checkbox and a PDF file widget appear.
- If you want the front cover to overlap with the first page of the PDF
  report, you should also check the Overlap Front Cover checkbox. Leave
  it unchecked if you don't want the front cover to overlap with the
  first page.
- The last step would be to upload the PDF file that will be used as the
  front cover. You can do this by clicking on the PDF file widget and
  selecting the file.
- Important! The file must be a PDF file, and it should have only one
  page. If it has more pages, only the first one will be used.
